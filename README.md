* The goal of this project is *goal*. Initialize CLAUDE.md with this information.
* *Insert requirements and goals here*. Devise an architectural plan in DESIGN.md and derive a detailed backlog for execution in RED/GREEN/REFACTOR test-driven development with non-shallow and non-tautological tests in BACKLOG.md. Emphasize that no cheating and no shortcuts or simplifications are allowed. Then commit and push.
* Follow BACKLOG.md and get it done. No cheating, no shortcuts, no simplifications. Write tests (RED phase), implement full functionality so running tests pass (GREEN phase), clean up implementation (REFACTOR phase), 
  update BACKLOG.md, commit, push. Go on to next task and repeat until all sprints are done.
* Check the whole codebase and all tests if you cheated or took a shortcut just to get something to look like it works superficially. Then fix it.
