## Thinking Mode

* The goal of this project is *goal*. Think hard, and initialize CLAUDE.md with this information.
* *Insert requirements and goals here*. Think hard, and devise an architectural plan in DESIGN.md and derive a detailed backlog for execution in RED/GREEN/REFACTOR test-driven development with non-shallow and non-tautological tests in BACKLOG.md. Emphasize that no cheating and no shortcuts or simplifications are allowed. Then commit and push.
* Follow BACKLOG.md and get it done. Think what to do, and make a detailed task list. No cheating, no shortcuts, no simplifications, no stubs. Write tests that initially fail (RED phase), implement full functionality to make them pass (GREEN phase), clean up implementation (REFACTOR phase), see that all tests still pass. Do this in small steps. After each step, update BACKLOG.md, commit, push. Go on to next task and repeat until all sprints are done.
* Check the whole codebase and all tests and think hard if you cheated or took a shortcut or wrote a stub just to get something to look like it works superficially. Then fix it.
* Think / Think hard / Think harder / Ultrathink about the current failing tests and problems, devise a solution strategy, and fix it.
