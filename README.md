* Devise an architectural plan in DESIGN.md and derive a detailed backlog for execution in BACKLOG.md. Emphasize that no cheating and no shortcuts are allowed. Then commit and push.
* Follow BACKLOG.md and get it done. No cheating and no shortcuts. Write test, implement, run tests, update BACKLOG.md, commit, push. Go on to next task and repeat until all sprints are done.
* Check the whole codebase and all tests if you cheated or took a shortcut just to get something to look like it works superficially. Then fix it.
